# Simple Notes

Application to create, edit, and delete notes stored on local storage.

This app was created using a base scaffolding tool (Yeoman) that I had customized. Template is customized for AngularJS, SASS, Grunt and Heroku deployment. You can see the template I use at https://github.com/ashlynaiu/ashlyn-template

This application uses my own lightweight SASS framework that I like to start with on projects. 

Run npm install, bower install, and then Grunt Serve to start up application on your local instance.
